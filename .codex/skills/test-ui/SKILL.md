description: Run console UI regression tests for this Java chatbot project from test/ui-test-plan.md. Use when asked to test command-line interactions, compare lists of console commands against expected outputs, verify missing-argument cases, or produce a record of test input/output.

# Test UI

Run console UI tests from `test/ui-test-plan.md`. Each test case records its aim,
console input, and expected console output.

## Test Plan Format

Use one `###` heading per test case. Each case must contain:

- `Aim:` one short sentence explaining what the test verifies.
- `Inputs:` followed by a fenced `text` block containing the exact console input.
- `Expected output:` followed by a fenced `text` block containing the exact expected console output.

The first input line should include the user name, because this chatbot asks for
the name before accepting commands.

## Run Tests

From the repository root, run:

```bash
python3 .codex/skills/test-ui/scripts/run-ui-tests.py
```

The script compiles `src/main/java/*.java`, runs `MrChatbot` once per test case,
and compares exact stdout with the expected output. It prints a console-session
record containing the input, expected output, and actual output for each tested
case.

If a test case fails, the script terminates immediately, reports the failing
test case, shows the actual and expected outputs, prints a unified diff, and
exits with a non-zero status.

## Update Tests

When adding a UI behavior, update `test/ui-test-plan.md` with at least one case
covering the main success path. For command parsing features, also add missing
argument or malformed input cases when relevant.
